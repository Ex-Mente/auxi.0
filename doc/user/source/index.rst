*********************************

Introduction
============
auxi's Python package was developed to make auxi available and extendible in Python. The aim of auxi is to enable engineers to develop models and perform simulations with these models efficiently and effectively. The package contains the following sub-packages and modules:

- modeling sub-package

  This package contains modules, functions and classes for developing different types of computational models.

- tools sub-package

  This package contains modules, functions and classes used to provide tools to aid the engineer with calculations.

auxi aims to provide a powerful set of infrastructure to take care of many repetitive and mundane tasks that need to be performed during modelling and simulation. This should help you to focus on higher level concepts and problems.
