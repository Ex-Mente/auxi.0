Material Modelling
==================
The auxi.modelling.process.materials package contains modules, functions and classes that help perform material-related calculations and build process models. Specifically, the package contains a module called "chemistry" for a material and material package that can perform chemistry calculations, another called "psd" for a particulate material and material package that can do size distribution as well as a material and material package that can, in addition, perform slurry calculations, and another called "thermochemistry" that contains a material consisting of multiple chemical compounds, having the ability to do thermochemical calculations.

Material Models
===============
The auxi.modelling.process.materials sub-package provides you with modules, classes and functions to do material modelling. The material models are divided into chemical, psd and thermochemistry.
