    "The :py:mod:`auxi.tools.chemistry.thermochemistry` module provides a number of useful functions for doing thermochemical calculations that would otherwise have been quite cumbersome to do. To make these calculations possible, some thermochemical data is needed. The :py:mod:`auxi` distribution package currently contains data for around 80 compounds. This may, however, not be sufficient for your process calculations. FactSage data can be converted into auxi thermochemical data using the :py:func:`~.auxi.tools.chemistry.thermochemistry.convert_fact_file_to_auxi_thermo_file` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare your own compound data files with FactSage, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open FactSage.\n",
    "Click on the \"View Data\" button.\n",
    "Select the \"Compound\" option, NOT \"Solution\".\n",
    "Select the database that you want to use. \"FactPS\" should be OK.\n",
    "Type the formula of the compound you need in the box at the bottom.\n",
    "Click OK.\n",
    "Click on the \"Cp(T)\" tab.\n",
    "Select \"File\" from the menu and then \"Save As ...\".\n",
    "Select the folder where you want to store all your thermochemical data files.\n",
    "The filename must have a specific format. Taking \"Ar\" as an example, use \"Compound_Ar.txt\" for the file name.\n",
    "Click \"Save\".\n",
    "You will have to repeat this procedure for all the compounds that you need to include in your calculations.\n",
