    "## Background\n",
    "It is often needed to calculate heat exchnage between surfaces and fluids due to natural convection. These calculations require the determination of a heat transfer coefficient. The coefficients are based on empirical correlations determined from experimental measurements. To save on the time required to locate the appropriate correlations from literature, `auxi`'s `naturalconvection` module provides models to make doing these calculations faster, easier, and more reliable."

To gain some insight into which regions are covered with proven correlations (grey), and which are covered by interpolation or extrapolation (red), these regions can be plotted as follows."
